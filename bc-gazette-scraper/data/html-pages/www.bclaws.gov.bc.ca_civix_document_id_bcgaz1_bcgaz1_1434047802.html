      <strong>Director of Civil Forfeiture </strong>
      <strong>
        <em>v.</em>
      </strong>
      <strong> Selina She Yin Tsui </strong>
      <strong>
        <em>et al</em>
      </strong> (British Columbia Supreme Court Action 09 1005). </p>
    <p>Money was recovered as a result of a settlement agreement in the above entitled action between the Director of Civil Forfeiture (the "Director") and Selina She Yin Tsui ("Tsui"). These funds have been forfeited to the Province of British Columbia under the <em>Civil Forfeiture Act</em>. </p>

    <p>Documented proof of payments for treatments which is satisfactory to the Director must be provided. This requirement may be satisfied by cancelled cheques, money orders, bank transfers or other official records produced by a financial institution. Compensation received from any other source with respect to the loss must be disclosed to the Director and will be deducted from any potential further compensation. </p>
    <p>If you believe you are eligible to claim compensation and wish to do so, you must complete an application and return it along with all required supporting documentation to the Director by the close of business on October 7, 2011. Applications received after this date will not be considered. </p>
    <p>Applications for compensation may be obtained by writing to the Director at PO Box 9234, Stn Prov Govt, Victoria BC  V8W 9J1, or by sending an email requesting an application to CivilFO@gov.bc.ca [je30] </p>
